            Parmarth is a project that aims to provide employment opportunities
            for persons with different types of disabilities. Society has had a
            reflectance towards people with disabilities and has had
            reservations about them becoming self-sufficient parts of the
            community.<br /><br />
            This idea comes from a very personal space for us, as seeing the
            plight of people with being unable to express themselves in the
            corporate world is very saddening; there are not a lot of resources
            for the same.

            Employment means being committed to participation in an activity
            with others and an occupational identity. For people with a
            disability, such aspects are even more important, largely because
            these individuals have become an increasingly marginalized group in
            contemporary working life, with its great demands for education,
            flexibility, and productivity.
            <br /><br />
            At Parmarth, we intend to support people with disability by giving
            them opportunities rather than sympathy. They want to feel that they
            are needed by others and that what they do is meaningful, in both
            their own eyes and in the eyes of others. We want to give them this
            opportunity to show their potential.
